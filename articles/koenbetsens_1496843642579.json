{"title":"Tuise Lesson one - How to clean install my RPi","content":"So you took your RPi home and embarked an heroic attempt to automate the grain flow on your chicken's den? We've all been there.\nAccidently cluttered the RPi with complete nonsense you're ashamed of now? We've got t-shirts.\n\nThere's always a **clean install** to the rescue.\n\n### Step 1.\nBuy a 8GB, 16GB or higher micro SD card and SD card shield. \nLike this one: https://www.gotron.be/huis-tuin/computer-toebehoren/geheugen/transcend-micro-sdhc-geheugenkaart-16gb-klasse-10.html \n\n\n### Step 2.\nAssuming you have a computer with a SD card reader, we'll now flash the SD.\n\n**Raspbian**\nDownload the +- 1,5GB Raspbian Jessie image.\nThere you go: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ - you'll want the Pixel flavour.\n\n**Etcher**\nBy far the easiest way to Flash that disk is called Esher.\nDownload it here: https://etcher.io/\n\nOnce Etcher is installed, you'll be able to select both the zip (you can leave it compressed) and the destination SD. \nDepending on your SD spec & brand, the flash process takes about 6 minutes.\n\n![Etcher](https://etcher.io/static/screenshot-1x.gif)\n\n\n### Step 3.\nTime to boot and update.\nInsert your Micro SD in the RPi (teeth up). Connect power & be proud of what you just realised.\nIt's a common practice to update before we finish off.\n\nOpen your CLI terminal and run the follwing 2 commands:\n\n```sudo apt-get update```\n```sudo apt-get dist-upgrade```\n\nThere you go.\n","category":"Hackfridays","hidden":false}
