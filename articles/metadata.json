We've all been there.\nAccidently cluttered the RPi with complete nonsense you're ashamed of now? We've got t-shirts.\n\nThere's always a **clean install** to the rescue.\n\n### Step 1.\nBuy a 8GB, 16GB or higher micro SD card and SD card shield. \nLike this one: [https://www.gotron.be/huis-tuin/computer-toebehoren/geheugen/transcend-micro-sdhc-geheugenkaart-16gb-klasse-10.html](https://www.gotron.be/huis-tuin/computer-toebehoren/geheugen/transcend-micro-sdhc-geheugenkaart-16gb-klasse-10.html) \n\n\n### Step 2.\nAssuming you have a computer with a SD card reader, we'll now flash the SD.\n\n##### Raspbian\nDownload the +- 1,5GB Raspbian Jessie image.\nThere you go: [https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) - you'll want the Pixel flavour.\n\n##### Etcher\nBy far the easiest way to Flash that disk is called Esher.\nDownload it here: [https://etcher.io/](https://etcher.io/)\n\nOnce Etcher is installed, you'll be able to select both the zip (you can leave it compressed) and the destination SD. \nDepending on your SD spec & brand, the flash process takes about 6 minutes.\n\n![Etcher](https://etcher.io/static/screenshot-1x.gif)\n\n\n### Step 3.\nTime to boot and update.\nInsert your Micro SD in the RPi (teeth up). Connect power & be proud of what you just realised.\nIt's a common practice to update before we finish off.\n\nOpen your CLI terminal and run the follwing 2 commands:\n\n```sudo apt-get update```\n\n```sudo apt-get dist-upgrade```\n\nThere you go.\n"}]}
